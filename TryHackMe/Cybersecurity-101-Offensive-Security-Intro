# Offensive Security

Offensive security focuses on thinking like an attacker in order to identify weaknesses in systems before malicious hackers can exploit them.

In this room, I learned how attackers discover hidden resources on a website. I used directory brute‑forcing tools such as `dirb`/DirBuster to enumerate hidden pages on a simulated banking website.

Through this process, I discovered hidden links that were not visible to normal users. These weaknesses demonstrated how poor access controls and exposed endpoints can be abused to compromise sensitive information.

## Key Takeaways
- Attackers actively search for hidden directories and pages
- Tools like `dirb` can reveal sensitive endpoints if misconfigured
- Proper access controls and security testing are critical for web applications
